### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description
For this assignment I had to prompt the user for two integers as inputs and give the user the sum, quotient, difference, and modulo of those two numbers. However I had to use a function to do this.

### Reflection

This was a benficial assignment because I learned how to use functions and realised what I can do with them. At first it was very confuysing looking at how to use function but now I understand that they take in variables and you have to use 'return' inside the function in order to output values.


## Python_Calculator

### Assignment_Description

For this assignment I had to make a program that prompted the user for 3 inputs and printed two roots if ithe function had two roots or 1 root if the function had one root or no roots if the function had no roots. I had to offer an option to run the program again and I had to code all this using a function.
